# Spike Train Simulation (Reproducible)

This project simulates neural spike train data randomly using a Poisson process, with the random seed fixed for reproducibility. It visualizes the spike train, calculates inter-spike intervals (ISI), and estimates the firing rate of a neuron.

## Features
- **Simulated Spike Train**: Generates random spike times based on a Poisson process with a fixed random seed for reproducibility.
- **ISI Histogram**: Visualizes the distribution of time intervals between spikes.
- **Firing Rate Calculation**: Estimates the firing rate based on simulated spikes.
